the Mecca of all Lovers, and therefore
the place where Journeys End.
Situated on a large tract of enchanted ground,
in the Country of Agapemone, Arcady is a
beautiful and interesting place, and should be
visited by every tourist making the Grand
Tour of Life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the shortest sojourn here will yield
rich rewards of interest and pleasure, and will
contribute more than long years of study to a

it with a steadfast purpose, others blindly

<p class='pindent'>The Province of Arcadia, whose capital is
Arcady (see map No. 1), is bounded on the North
by the Land of Heart’s Desire, from which it
is separated by the Happy Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the East it is bounded by the Gulf of
Time, across which dimly may be seen, in the
distance, the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the West by the Mountains of Opposition,
beyond which is the Gulf of Dark
Despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the Southern Shores murmur the lapping
wavelets of the Sea of Dreams, whose
wonderful phenomenon of Mirage often deceives
even an experienced traveler.</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'><a id='rout'></a><span class='sc'><span style='font-size:larger'>Routes</span></span>: Travelers may approach Arcady by
several routes. One of the pleasantest is the
Joy Line, by which passengers are carried across
the Sea of Dreams in Transports of Rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span></p>

<p class='caption'>“ACROSS THE SEA OF DREAMS IN TRANSPORTS OF RAPTURE”</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another approach, preferred by adventurous
ones in search of excitement, is across the
Seas of Misunderstanding, through the troubled
waters of the Gulf of Wo, and over the difficult
and well-nigh impassable Mountains of Opposition.
However, when these mountains
are safely crossed the way is delightful and
easy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='road'></a><span class='sc'><span style='font-size:larger'>Roads out of Arcady</span></span>: The Road to Fame
often leads out of Arcady. An ambitious youth,
hearing a silvery trumpet note, looks up to see
a radiant Goddess beckoning to him. Unless a
true Lover, he may be dazzled by her glory and
cajoled by her promises. Lured away, he follows
the fickle Fair and soon loses all interest
in Arcadian delights.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Road to Wealth is another easy way out
of Arcady. Not content with the Pot of Gold
at the End of the Rainbow, many with a greed
for lucre will follow the Goddess Fortune, who
is even more false and fickle than the Goddess
Fame.</p>

<a id='seas'></a><span class='sc'><span style='font-size:larger'>Season</span></span>: Arcady is an all-the-year-round resort,
and most of the districts described may
be visited at any season of the year. Spring
and Early Summer are perhaps best for an
initial visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>June is an especially desirable time for young
lovers to be in Arcady, but Lovelorn Swains and
Minor Poets frequently choose the melancholy
days of Autumn.</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'><a id='clim'></a><span class='sc'><span style='font-size:larger'>Climate</span></span>: The Climatic conditions of Arcady
are peculiar. Though usually the weather is
balmy and pleasant, sometimes a sudden coolness
springs up and a frost is often distinctly
felt. A stormy time may ensue, and then suddenly
the clouds clear away and all is sunshine
once more.</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<p class='pindent'><a id='time'></a><span class='sc'><span style='font-size:larger'>Time</span></span>: Time in Arcady is entirely a matter
of opinion. To a waiting Lover the minutes
are hours and lag slowly along, while to happy
hearts a golden day flies by as if on wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that Love makes Time pass away,
and Time makes Love pass away; but the latter
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
statement is obviously an error, for after Love
has made Time pass away, how can Time do
anything to Love?</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, ’tis Love that makes the world
go round, and this explains why Love makes
Time pass so rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Watches are of little use in Arcady, as the
Lovers deem them always too slow or too fast,
and usually forget to wind them, anyway. The

whose refrain is:</p>

Forever and Never are the units of time
most employed by Arcadians, and their meanings
are synonymous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time when Lovers are separated is measured
by ages; when together, it is not measured at
all, as then the hours unheeded fly, or speed on
winged feet.</p>

<p class='line'>He reached for his inkhorn and quill, then said,</p>

<p class='line'>But I hear she beats Time, so she won’t do;</p>

<p class='line'>A pretty clubwoman I saw one day,</p>
<p class='line'>But ‘I won’t have Time,’ I heard her say.</p>
<p class='line'>For one of those summer girls I yearn;</p>

<p class='line'>There are lovely girls in a Southern clime,</p>
<p class='line'>But they sweetly admit that they waste Time,</p>
<p class='line'>While the bustling woman, with manners curt,</p>
<p class='line'>Takes Time by the forelock, and that does hurt.</p>
<p class='line'>On the Boston maiden I make no claim,</p>
<p class='line'>To improve Time seems to be her aim.</p>
<p class='line'>And I heard an old spinster contriving a plan</p>
<p class='line'>Say, ‘I’ll try to get Time as soon as I can.’</p>
<p class='line'>So none of these whom I’ve mentioned yet</p>
<p class='line'>A Valentine from Time shall get.</p>
<p class='line'>But I’ve in mind a maiden who,</p>
<p class='line'>When a fond lover came to woo,</p>
<p class='line'>Just blushed and hung down her pretty head,</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Lothario Lee was saddened, the world seemed grim and gray;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For Lothario Lee was a lover bold, and today was St. Valentine’s Day.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>’Twas St. Valentine’s Day, and he fain would send his heart to the fair Florelle,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For the radiant maid had inspired in his breast a passion he could not quell.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>But alas! for the gay Lothario, his heart was held in fee</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Down at Dan Cupid’s pawnshop, at the sign of the roses three.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Willingly would the lovelorn knight that errant heart reclaim,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But alas! the luckless Lothario hadn’t a cent to his name.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>So he sadly sat and pondered, as doleful as he could be;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When a brilliant notion struck him—“Done!” cried Lothario Lee.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“I’ll send her the pawnshop ticket, my tale of wo ’twill tell,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For she alone can redeem my heart—the rich and rare Florelle.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>He sent her the tell-tale ticket, he scribbled a hasty line,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Bidding her call at Dan Cupid’s shop and claim her valentine.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>And as she read the message, in the soul of the fair Florelle</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A joyful thought rang merrily, like a far-away marriage bell.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>With her heart in a frantic flutter, adown the street sped she,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Till she reached Dan Cupid’s pawnshop, at the sign of the roses three.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Cupid sat at a work-bench, mending a broken dart;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“I am Florelle,” said she, “and I come to claim Lothario’s heart.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Here is the ticket, Cupid; what are the ransom fees?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>See, I will pay you the money; give me the heart, if you please.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“But I am blind,” said Cupid, “I cannot see the name;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Describe the heart you are looking for, and so make good your claim.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Lothario’s heart,” said the lady, “is brave and knows no fear.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Alas!” said Cupid, dejectedly, “no such heart is here.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“His heart,” said the lady, further, “is honest, and good, and true.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“No,” said Dan Cupid, wofully, “not one of these hearts will do.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“His heart to me is single, it beats for me alone.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Come, come,” cried Cupid, “impossible! Such hearts I’ve never known.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“The best in my collection has been mended once or twice,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But here’s a heart that may suit you, if you’re willing to pay the price.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“It’s a heart that is sad and lonely, a trifle hard and cold,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>It seems to be rather scarred and worn—in fact, it’s getting old.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“It’s somewhat fickle and jealous, a bit impatient, too;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And it’s branded with several maidens’ names—Coralie, Rose, and Loo.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Why, that’s the very heart I want,” said the lady, “give it to me;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That’s the one I’ve been describing to you, the heart of Lothario Lee.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>As she left the shop in triumph, said Cupid, “I seem to find</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span><h1>HISTORY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The early history of Arcady is lost in the
mists of ancient tradition. Looking backward
through the reversed Opera Glass of Time, we
see that it was originally settled by Adam and
Eve. Since then it has been peopled by lovers
of every age, sex, and condition of servitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These people are usually gentle and mild-mannered,
though occasionally given to angry
or quarrelsome outbreaks caused by jealousy
or misunderstanding. These outbreaks, however,
are indulged in mostly for the pleasure of
kissing and making up afterward, and forgiveness
is one of their chief characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Arcadians are not gregarious, but go
about in couples, or sit solitary and alone, wrapt
in rapt thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The male population is divided into Lovers,
Poets, and Lunatics. There are various types
of Lovers—those that sigh like a furnace, those
that are pale and wan, and Swains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swains are usually Rustic or Lovelorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feminine Arcadians are called Queens, Goddesses,
Angels, and other titles of incredible
foolishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In physical appearance dwellers in Arcady
are beautiful beyond all words. The women
have eyes as stars of twilight fair, faces with
gardens in, lily hands, amber-dropping hair,
and feet like little mice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men are handsome as Apollos; of heroic
size and Chesterfieldian manners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The above-mentioned qualities, though not
always apparent to the disinterested observer,
are realized and insisted upon by the Lovers
themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oftenest the Citizens of Arcady are transients
and come and go as circumstances decree, but
in some rare instances a happy pair spend their
whole life in Arcady, or wander through the
Happy Valley and make their home in the Land
of Heart’s Desire.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span><h1>ARCADIA</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The province of Arcadia proper, the country
between the Sea of Dreams and the Land of
Heart’s Desire (see map No. 2), is a large district
with well-defined boundaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natural scenery is delightful, being chiefly
made up of flowery meads and sylvan dells
threaded by murmuring or babbling brooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The River Lethe flows through the country,
at one point dashing over a precipice in a great
Cataract. This is known as Lover’s Leap
and is, at times, the scene of fearful tragedies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despairing Swains threaten to end their lives
by dashing into the seething waters, unless their
capricious sweethearts will smile on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the sweethearts usually smile, death rarely,
if ever, ensues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the middle of the Country of Arcadia
is its capital, the town of Arcady, which is
described elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the Northwest lies Lotus Land, the
land where it is always afternoon, where the
charmed sunset lingers low adown in the red
West.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/i045f.jpg'><img src='images/i045.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0014' style='width:500px;height:auto;'/></a>
<p class='caption'>LAND OF HEARTS DESIRE—ARCADY and its Environs</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The inhabitants are the mild-eyed, melancholy
Lotus-Eaters, whose cult is Indolence set
to Music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mossy banks of Lotus Land slope down
to the River Lethe, and propt on beds of amaranth
and moly the Lotus-Eaters delight to watch
the long bright river drawing slowly and hear
the dewy echoes calling and watch the emerald
color’d water falling, and things like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the river from Lotus Land lies the
Garden of the Hesperides. These enterprising
maidens do a brisk trade in Golden Apples,
but this district must not be confounded with
the Garden of Eden, as they are not the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going southward, following the shores of
the Gulf of Time, we come to the Land of Yesterday—and
further South to Never Never
Land. These are beautiful and attractive spots
much sought by Lovers of retrospective and
imaginative tendencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the West side of the river, just South of
Lotus Land, lies Wanderland, and nearby are
the Elysian Fields. These districts are usually
thronged with Lovers sauntering about in pairs,
each couple being entirely oblivious of all the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further South we come to Dangerous Ground,
which slopes down to Lover’s Leap. Near here
is Fool’s Paradise. This is a popular spot and
often most delicious adventures may be met
here. The dwellers in Fool’s Paradise are absurdly
happy, and sometimes climb a small
eminence in the center of the place, known as
the Height of Folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the West is a range of Blue Mountains.
The despairing swain often climbs these, but
when he reaches Mount Hope the world looks
brighter and he soon gets back to the Happy
Valley.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span><h1>ARCADY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Arcady, the capital and chief city of the
province of Arcadia, is a thickly settled town,
with delightful outlying districts and suburban
surroundings.</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'><a id='prel'></a><span class='sc'><span style='font-size:larger'>Preliminary Ramble</span></span>: The stranger visiting
Arcady for the first time cannot do better than
to begin by a walk down Lovers’ Lane, where he
must surely be impressed by the shady trees and
luxuriantly blooming flowers. Although sometimes
flooded with morning sunshine, it is usually
evening in Arcady. The moon shines always,
sometimes a Honeymoon glows brightly, and
there are generally stars, or perhaps a tender
twilight with a fading sunset. On each side of
the lane are the small houses of the Love-in-a-Cottage
Colony. These cottages are rose-embowered
and have white dimity curtains tied
with blue ribbons. Crossing Lovers’ Lane at
right angles is Primrose Path, the fashionable
street of Arcady. The dwellings here are air
castles (mostly of Spanish architecture) and
dreams of marble halls. One of the most
celebrated mansions is Claude Melnotte’s:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>A palace lifting to eternal summer</p>
<p class='line0'>Its marble walls, from out a glossy bower</p>
<p class='line0'>Of coolest foliage musical with birds,</p>
<p class='line0'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. while the perfumed light</p>
<p class='line0'>Stole through the mists of alabaster lamps,</p>
<p class='line0'>And every air was heavy with the sighs</p>
<p class='line0'>Of orange groves and music from sweet lutes,</p>
<p class='line0'>And murmurs of low fountains that gush forth</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ the midst of roses!</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Farther on a shaft of moonlight falls on
Juliet’s balcony, and beyond rise the towers
and turrets of the Castle of La Joyeuse Garde.
Primrose Path leads to Fool’s Paradise, but
turning off to the West the traveler may stroll
through Paradise Alley to the Elysian Fields.
This beautiful spot is always fanned by south
winds, and among its flowery arbors may be
heard the songs of larks, nightingales, and turtle
doves. Beyond lies the Forest of Arden. Here
sturdy oaks covered with clinging vines abound;
but the tree most frequently seen is the Trysting
Tree. These trees are interesting to visitors
because of the symbols carved on their
bark. Here one may notice the entwined initials
of Aucassin and Nicolette; there the true
lover’s knot of Orpheus and Eurydice, or the
overlapping hearts of Abelard and Heloise.
Crossing a stile we wander by the brookside,
or pause for a while at the old Ruined Mill to
count the Shooting Stars.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span><h1>FLORA</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The flowers in Arcady are perennial and
bloom all the year round. There are roses for
every stage of the game, from the blush rose to
the Bride Rose. There are moss roses for those
who love old-fashioned flowers, and the Last
Rose of Summer is a variety much admired by
Romanticists. There are many old-fashioned
gardens in Arcady, and here may be seen Bleeding
Hearts, Forget-me-nots, Love-Lies-Bleeding,
Pansies for Thoughts, and Rosemary for Remembrance.
There is also Heartsease and Rue.
There are lanes of lilacs and orchards of apple
bloom. There are daisy fields and groves of
orange trees in blossom. Wild flowers grow
everywhere and mistletoe is indigenous. In
the flower-shops may be bought orchids or violets
in wealthy effects. In the Souvenir Shops
one may find pressed or dried flowers, and
these are much in demand. Poppies grow wild
along the banks of the Lethe River, and the
moon-flower flourishes in many gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hotels in Arcady are excellent, with
large and well-kept gardens, rose-embowered
lawns, ivy-hung turrets, and all requirements
of Romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the interior of the town is Halcyon Hall,
owned by the Lovemore Company. This is
a new and sumptuous hotel, fitted up with a
careful attention to detail, which combines
eighteenth-century romance with nineteenth-century
convenience. Among its advantages
over the older hostelries are:</p>

<p class='pindent'>An Express Elevator to the Seventh Heaven,
and a Dream Interpreter Call and United
States Valentine Chute on every floor. It
is also lighted by an Automatic Electric
Moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other important hotels are Orchid Court,
Honeymoon Hall, and Violet Villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Grand Union is an old and well-known
hotel for married lovers. Less pretentious hostelries
are the bijou Villa Beaubelle, Starlight
Cottage, and Cupid’s Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many Inns, both quaint and interesting.
Their swinging sign-boards announce
such appropriate appellations as “Arms and
the Man,” “The Moon and I,” or “The World
is Mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The St. Valentine Apartment House, situated
on Good Times Square, is a residential
building of the first class.</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
<a id='rest'></a><span class='sc'><span style='font-size:larger'>Restaurants</span></span>: These institutions are not
specially popular in Arcady, as the inhabitants
rarely have large appetites. Indeed, waiters
often set artificial viands before their patrons,
and the difference is not observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guests are always overcharged, as the true
Lover has no thought of what he is paying and
settles any bill without a murmur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very popular table d’hôte service consists
of Bread and Cheese and Kisses, and the partakers
thereof drink to each other only with
their eyes and leave a kiss in the cup, so that
wine is never asked for.</p>

<p class='line'>Would you know what makes the music? On each slender, quivering blade</p>

<p class='line'>In their brave interpretation of the music in the grass.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;By the roguish breezes tossed</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;You might think it would get lost,</p>
<p class='line'>But the careful fairies guard it, watching closely as they pass.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So on every summer day,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Sounding faint and far away,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arcady is oftenest traversed on foot, as
Lovers would rather stroll together through the
beautiful country than to ride, and many of
them walk on air. But, if desired, any vehicle
for two may be obtained at the Livery Stables.
Old-fashioned sidebar buggies and hansom cabs
are much in demand, and some swains still enjoy
a bicycle built for two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the water all sorts of boats are used.
On moonlight nights and balmy afternoons,
and also in the radiant glow of the early morning,
the lakes and streams are dotted with Shallops,
Cockle-Shells, or Gondolas, in which loving
pairs are idly drifting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also, at the Livery Stables, palfreys may
be engaged for eloping purposes, or chargers

<p class='line'>One summer day, poor little Cupid</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Sat sadly poring o’er his slate.</p>
<p class='line'>“I fear I must be very stupid,”</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He said, and shook his curly pate.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And then he ran away to Venus.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Dear mother, help me! if you will,</p>
<p class='line'>I’m sure,” he cried, “that we between us</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Can straighten out Sir Strephon’s bill.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Said Venus, “Just as I expected!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;You always do make such a fuss</p>
<p class='line'>With bills!” But soon it was corrected,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And the account was rendered thus:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Sir Strephon—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To Dan Cupid, Dr.,</p>

<p class='line'>To seven arrows, lost or broken.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To one heart by a blunder hit.</p>
<p class='line'>To one new bow. To one love-token.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Terms cash. No credit. Please remit.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Hasten,” cried Venus, “do not tarry!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Today is Strephon’s wedding-day.</p>
<p class='line'>Unless he settle e’er he marry,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Cupid may whistle for his pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joy Rides are usually clandestine and secret.
They often end disastrously, but this is part

moving crawl, but again it may be a break-neck
dash. Joy Rides have been popular in Arcady
for many centuries. Some have been immortalized
in Song and Story. Robert Browning’s

<p class='pindent'>For those who wish to derive the greatest
possible pleasure from a visit to Arcady, some
acquaintance with the Language of Love is indispensable.
This can best be acquired by a
careful study of poetry and romantic novels,
and about four hours’ practise every day.
(“The Lover’s Phrase Book” is a useful little
treatise, as it gives four thousand terms of endearment,
alphabetically arranged, and is small
enough to be carried in the pocket, for ready
reference, in case of love at first sight.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Language of Love is largely composed of
adjectives and expletives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hyperbole and other flowery figures of speech
abound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is also peculiarly rich in idioms, most of
which are generally unintelligible, being made
up by those who use them.</p>

<hr class='tbk130'/>

<p class='pindent'>The beginner usually thus learns the first
principles of conjugation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First Person, I love. This is a joy and a
revelation and he is the happiest man on earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second Person, Thou lovest. This completes
his rapture and he is in Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third Person, He loves. This is known as
the Tertium Quid and casts the beginner into
the depths of Hades.</p>

<p class='line'>Ever so many years ago,</p>
<p class='line'>When Cupid was quite young, you know,</p>
<p class='line'>There were no schools at all, and so,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Athirst for information,</p>
<p class='line'>Each day the funny little chap</p>
<p class='line'>Would climb up in Dame Venus’ lap,</p>
<p class='line'>And study from a book or map</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To get his education.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He traced in his Geography</p>
<p class='line'>The Primrose Path to Arcady;</p>
<p class='line'>He bounded Agapemone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Flowery Fields Elysian.</p>
<p class='line'>Then, his Arithmetic begun,</p>
<p class='line'>He learned that one and one make one,</p>
<p class='line'>That one from two leaves simply none,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Love abhors division.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>From Botany he learned to know</p>
<p class='line'>The value of the mistletoe,</p>
<p class='line'>And why a rose is cherished so,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Even when it is faded.</p>
<p class='line'>Rhetoric taught him how to say</p>
<p class='line'>Fair speeches in a pretty way;</p>
<p class='line'>And if a lass should murmur “Nay,”</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;How she must be persuaded.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>On History’s thrilling page he met</p>
<p class='line'>With Romeo and Juliet,</p>
<p class='line'>Brave Aucassin and Nicolette,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And other hearts devoted.</p>
<p class='line'>Then in Astronomy he found</p>
<p class='line'>What ’tis that makes the world go round,</p>
<p class='line'>And why the moon is so renowned,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And shooting stars are noted.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>In Grammar Cupid had to say</p>
<p class='line'>“I love, thou lov’st, he loves,” each day,</p>
<p class='line'>And learn of hearts declined, that they</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Can still be conjugated.</p>
<p class='line'>He studied the Industrial Arts,</p>
<p class='line'>Became adept at mending hearts,</p>
<p class='line'>Right skilfully he fashioned darts,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And wondrous love-knots plaited.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A Magic course he had to take,</p>
<p class='line'>And for sad hearts that ache or break</p>
<p class='line'>Love-philters strange he learned to make</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;From musk and myrrh and myrtle.</p>
<p class='line'>He studied deeply souls that yearned,</p>
<p class='line'>Investigated hearts that burned,</p>
<p class='line'>And all the tricks and habits learned</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Of doves, both ring and turtle.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And so Dan Cupid is no fool,</p>
<p class='line'>But he’s well versed in love and rule,</p>
<p class='line'>Although he never went to school</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And never went to college.</p>
<p class='line'>He’s blind, and yet the rogue can see</p>
<p class='line'>A thousand times as well as we;</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span><h1>POLITICAL NOTES</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Arcady is an Absolute Monarchy. It is
under Home Rule, and Home is where the
Heart is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each citizen is a King or Queen, and rules
one subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any Monarch may be deposed suddenly and
supplanted by another. Beside being a Monarch
each citizen is a slave, and thus the balance
of power is preserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Declaration of Dependence is signed by
all good Arcadians.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='laws'></a>ARCADIAN LAWS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Be sure you’re right then lose your head.
A fool and his money are soon married.
A little debutante is a dangerous thing.
Proposals make cowards of us all.
There’s no fool like a bold fool.
The longest way round is the sweetest way home.
One good kiss deserves another.
’Tis love that makes the man come round.
Kisses speak louder than words.
People who live in glass houses shouldn’t hold hands.
The woman who deliberates is won.
Where there’s a will there’s a wedding.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span><h1>COSTUMES</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There is a tradition of Arcadian simplicity in
dress, but it is not always observed. The men,
unless Poets, are often most careful dressers,
and the women deck themselves in whatever
garb they deem most attractive to men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>White muslin with blue ribbons is a popular
costume, and “some sort of white, shimmering
stuff” is much used for gowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some women are clever enough to please the
men by wearing all black or all white, and the
hats are invariably large black ones or broad-leafed,
rose-decked straws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunshades, fans, floating scarfs, and many
coy adjuncts or fripperies of dress are seen,
and flowers are much worn or carried.</p>

<p class='line'>Oh, would I had lived in Arcadian days,</p>
<p class='line'>When maidens had not such extravagant ways,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When Daphne and Doris</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And Chloe and Chloris</p>
<p class='line'>Would laugh with delight o’er a ribbon of blue</p>
<p class='line'>Or a glittering buckle to wear on a shoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delightful walks abound in Arcady and
its environs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If unaccustomed to its devious ways, it is
perhaps better to engage the services of an
experienced Guide, which may be had for a
song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature Lovers enjoy the walk out on the old
Romany Road, across the Field of Four-Leafed
Clover toward the Forest of Arden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more Sentimental Journey is along the
Primrose Way, up Primrose Hill, and on, beyond
the Night, across the Day, thus following
the Course of True Love. Though this never
runs smooth, it is often attempted by young
Lovers, who sometimes persevere along the way
and sometimes get sidetracked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Friends’ Shipyard is a pleasant stroll for
an idle summer day. Here may be seen the
Sailor laddies making knots. True lover’s knots
may be bought here and carried away as
souvenirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another attractive walk is along Wall Street.
A delightful wall, full of nooks and crannies
and overhung with blossoming vines, runs all
along this street. At the corner of Moonshine
Avenue is a beautiful monument representing
Pyramus and Thisbe.</p>

<hr class='tbk131'/>

<p class='pindent'>A pleasant short ramble is along Amourette
Avenue, past the Cosy Corners, to a Bower of
Roses by Bendemeer’s Stream. The stream
may be crossed by the Rustic Bridges or by the
Stepping Stones, both being equally romantic.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“W</span>hat is the matter, Kiddums?” said
Dame Venus, as Cupid entered her
boudoir, with his blue ribbon untied
and limply dragging behind him, and his eyes
shining through big tears, like bluebirds taking
a bath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, I’m a ruined man,” and Cupid
flung himself into his own little chair, with a
Delsarte gesture expressive of deepest dejection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What now, what now, my child?” gently
inquired his beautiful parent, holding her hand-mirror
a little to one side, that she might better
perceive her troubled offspring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, just this. Some of those fools of
finance have organized a Great Heart Trust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Cupid, not really! Then your occupation
is indeed gone! They have taken the
very hearts out of your mouth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mother; and aside from the loss of
my business, just think how horrid it is to commercialize
it so! Why, I went to their office
to make sure the report was true, and there
they were, those horrible magnets,—or whatever
they call them,—huddled round a ticker,
and yelling out to one another such things as
these: ‘Loyal Hearts preferred. Chicago making
bold advance; sharp dealings noticed. Colorado
Springs Hearts failed to rally; feeling
weak and generally depressed; later, showed a
slight reaction. Spinsters, no demand.’ I don’t
know what it all means, I’m sure; but I see my
finish, and I may as well break my arrows and
unstring my bow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a Delsarte gesture of vindictiveness
and despair, Cupid doubled up his rosy, dimpled
knee and snapped an arrow across it, throwing
the pieces on the floor. Then he began to
unstring his beautiful, curved bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Venus looked sympathetically at her only
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” she began, “it isn’t as bad as you
think, dear. Perhaps,—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, isn’t that just like a woman!” exclaimed
Cupid; his round pink cheeks growing
rounder and pinker as he stormed on. “I
just guess, Mother, if you had been down to
the Heart Exchange and had heard and seen
what I did, you wouldn’t say, ‘Perhaps and
perhaps.’ Why, I strolled over to listen to two
of the magnets talking. One man said there
was a corner in the matrimonial market and
the other said he was too visionary, for that
market wasn’t at all affected by the Heart
Trust. He said it was only a question of a deal
in futures. I don’t know what they mean by
such talk as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I don’t either, Cupid,” said Venus,
laying down her mirror; for she had begun to
realize that the question was serious and she
must give it her undivided attention, which is
a difficult matter for a real Venus. “Tell me
more, Son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I looked over a man’s shoulder, and
he was reading from another of those ticker
things. He was a horrid man, not the kind I
like to deal with, at all. He read things like
this: ‘Summer Girls. Sensational Advances.
No Reserve. Public Wary. Actresses not well
supported, but best of financial backing; good
figures.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Cupid, dearie, you’re not interested in
hearts like those, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mother, you know perfectly well that
a man in my business position is obliged to deal
in all sorts of hearts. And I’ve always had
a monopoly of the market. Now the Great
Heart Trust has spoiled my trade entirely.”
He broke another arrow across his knee and his
quiver seemed to have transferred itself to his
rosy lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Son,” began Venus, hopefully,
“doesn’t this affect city hearts only? Can’t
you go to the country, and in the flowery fields
and lovers’ lanes find all the business you can
attend to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mother,” and the curly head drooped
like a dandelion at midday. “This Great
Heart Trust is universal. I stole a look at one
of their papers this morning, and one column
was headed ‘Rural Reports.’ Then it said:
‘Country depressed, dull; moving slowly. Domestic
Products quiet and well-behaved; in
great demand. Southern peach crop very fine;
quickly snapped up.’ I can’t understand all
their queer terms, but I suppose I shall have
to learn them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Cupid, do that. Meet them on their
own ground and fight them with their own
weapons. You know more about hearts than
they do; think of your long experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother! Imagine me occupying a seat
in the Heart Exchange! Why, I’d have to wear
a ticker ribbon instead of my blue sash. No,
I never could learn their language. Why, they
talk like this: ‘Coquettes’ hearts, Common
stock; a declining movement shows a hardening
tendency, but the stock is unsteady, with exciting
effects.’ And not only our own people are
concerned, but they quote prices on Foreign
Hearts, and, Mother, the rates are almost prohibitive.
Then one report said, ‘Fiancées’
Hearts; do not fear local pressure!’ Now what
can such talk mean? Then it said: ‘Boston.
(See Ice Trust.)’ No, Mother, it’s no use; I
can’t understand their jargon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Cupid, you can learn. The age is
progressive and you must keep up with it.
You know yourself that for some time your
methods of dealing in hearts have been considered
old-fashioned. Now you must try more
up-to-date ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mother, some reports are so sad.
Their paper said today that there were many
heart failures reported. Why, one heart broke
at sixty—during a period of depression! And
then they quoted ‘Hearts Bowed Down.’ That
seemed to be a falling market, with heavy sales.
Several hearts were lost or stolen, and altogether
it made me feel panic-stricken. And what do
you think, they quoted ‘Husbands’ as inclined
to firmness, but showing bearish indications!
No, it’s all out of my line. I know my business,
I’ve practised it many, many years, and
I’m too old to learn new tricks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Venus looked at her son in much the same way
that any mother looks at her child when she
knows she can help him out of his difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear, silly child,” she said, “you’re
needlessly alarmed. Every trust must have
its day, but they all fail sooner or later. Bide
your time, and after a while you’ll find that the
trust is all over, and you can carry on the game
in your own sweet way. I have heard of some
kind of a queer machine,—I think it’s called
a ‘trust buster,’—invented just on purpose to
break up these trusts. I’ll get you one. Now
kiss me and run away and play.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>RCADY: A terrible airquake has
wrought havoc in the densely populated
atmosphere above this locality.
Without a word of warning, noble and beautiful
castles in the air went toppling to their ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though difficult to get details in these first
hours of confusion and distress, it is known
that the sumptuous air castle built by Claude
Melnotte for the Lady of Lyons is entirely demolished.
The devastated area is widespread, and
from the most magnificent dream of marble halls
to the humblest vision of love in a cottage, all
of the <span class='it'>Chateaux en Espagne</span> have fallen. It is
feared that many loves have been lost in the
ruins. Even now the agents of the Love Insurance
Company are on the spot estimating the
casualties. Many of the survivors declare they
will rebuild at the earliest possible moment.
Indeed, it may safely be predicted that new and
more elaborate and beautiful castles in the air
will soon take the place of the old ones. Among
the débris of ruined hopes and shattered ideals,
pathetic sights may be seen. Here a broken
resolution sticks up through the mass of fragments,
there a broken promise; and everywhere
are fallen idols and upset plans. The explorer
is menaced by pits of boiling imagination and
fine frenzies rolling. But relief supplies are
already being received. A ship, with Youth
at the helm and Pleasure at the prow, has just
come into the harbor, bringing a cargo of fresh
hopes and such stuff as dreams are made of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Owing to the prevalence of mirage it is difficult
to give definite statistics; but the pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow is still visible,
and the sanguine, light-hearted people have
already begun to rear anew their castles in
the air.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
